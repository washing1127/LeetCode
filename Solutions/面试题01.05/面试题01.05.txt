面试题 01.05. One Away LCCI
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
first = "pale"
second = "ple"
Output: True
Example 2:

Input: 
first = "pales"
second = "pal"
Output: False
