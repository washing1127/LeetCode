√Ê ‘Ã‚ 01.09. String Rotation LCCI
Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 (e.g.,"waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat"). Can you use only one call to the method that checks if one word is a substring of another?

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "waterbottle", s2 = "erbottlewat"
Output: True
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "aa", s2 = "aba"
Output: False
 

Note:

0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100000
